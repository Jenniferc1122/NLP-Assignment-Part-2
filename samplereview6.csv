"Absolutely ink-redible DLC! An amazing attribute to Splatoon 2! Much better than the games actual story, with fun and enticing gameplay, an interesting story, and difficult levels. Worth every penny!"
"In retrospect, I can see why critics gave this such a low score, but I can also see why players liked it. This is easily one of the most disturbing games I've ever played. From atmosphere to gore. It is very dark, and I'm not talking about the lighting. The story is very easy to follow and it does not tie in with the first game (which I have not played) so it could of been a stand alone. The graphics for it's time were huge and beautiful and still kind of are, but you can tell in some areas it's a little dated. The gameplay is straight forward linear, in very short levels which is a shame because the levels are so nicely detailed. There is a small variety of weapons to pick from and surprisingly they all have different effects on enemies. For example a headshot with the Colt .45 (at least, I'm assuming that's what it is) could put an enemy down where a headshot with the magnum in the right place might take off a chunk of the face or the whole head from the jaw up. You can also take off arms if shots are placed just right. The game itself is sadly too short, no more then five hours in length. There are no extras to unlock or secrets to find. The biggest slap in the face was probably no multiplayer. Voice acting is almost a dead on perfect which is very rare in games. The bad parts besides the levels and such would also be the mouse sensitivity. It's default state is worthless and I recommend you max it out, you will still turn slow however but it is much better then before. The F.O.V. is very bad, it looks like it's in the 55 to 65 range, it cannot be changed. 90 to 95 is where most people like it because now you can see almost all you need to. Ironsights on weapons. Yes, this is one of the very few games where it is easier to use the crosshair (which can be turned off) then to line up a shot. Why? Well it's easy, the sights are broken and throw your shot off. You've spent all of your shots just to get one or two hits in, the only sights that seem to work are on the fixed machine guns. You will be facing off against infected American, Vietcong forces and Vietnam civilians. (Note that this is one of the almost non-existent games that to kill and infected you MUST get a dead on head shot. Or use a grenade.) Also non infected Vietcong forces. There are too many quick time scenes but you do have a choice at the end of each one: A Shoot B Bash face in Once you get to the end I was surprised there are two endings depending on option you choose in the last level ending. All in all I would like to see a continuation of this, but I don't think it will happen. Rebellion has made some good games, some okay ones, and ones that are flat out poop. This is a good one if you like zombies and do not mind linear generic shooters."
"As long as the story is good, I don’t care who they expose as good and who as bad. But there is no good story, there is nothing at all worth spending money for. CoD:MW is an original trilogy with an exciting story. And this is just a parody."
Gameplay : 8 Graphics : 9 Story : 8 Sound : 7 **********************************************************************************Overall : 8
Disappointing compared to the originals and way to easy. In my opinion the Pokemon games get worse each game. It's not terrible and X and Y have a lot of good points such as the game looking great. However in my opinion the positives just don't outweigh the negatives enough for me to love this game. Again I enjoyed playing it but it was still incredibly disappointing.
"The worst gt game. Physics are good, graphics are ""fine"", sound is still below the modern standard. The problem is, this is neither a Gran Turismo game -enjoying the car variety (also parts and tuning are non-existent/a joke), nor a good e-sports game, due to the penalties, which get worse every update. How depressing. Rooms/lobby experience is ridiculous: there's no race start timer, and car categories are terrible. I believe the next installment will be great..."
